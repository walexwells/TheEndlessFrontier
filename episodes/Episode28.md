The cool smell of evergreen trees filled Sarah's nostrils. In a groggy state she felt the cot beneath her and tried to remember where she was. Filling her with fear, her memory slowly returned.

A man had called her, wanting to know about William. He said he was William's brother and wanted any information that might help find him. After telling him on the phone that she had already told the police everything she knew and that they were trying, he offered to take her out to lunch so they could talk about it. Unable to say no, she reluctantly accepted. She was tired of repeating how little she knew, wishing she knew more.

Lunch had been a ruse. Instead of taking her to a restaurant, he took her to a large office building, not saying a word the whole drive there even when she had tried to start a conversation. He just stared ahead and kept driving. In the parking garage below the building, after he brushed off her comment about there not being a restaurant in the building, she had demanded he take her home. He had been walking in front of her and turned around with a wicked smile on his face. She couldn't remember anything after that.

“Where am I?” she tried to ask, but the words came out jumbled and she had a hard time opening her eyes. Above her she could only see green, but in a moment a blurry face appeared above her.

“You are going to be alright Sarah,” the face said. She recognized that voice.

“William?”

“Yes, it is me.”

“What is going on? Where are we?” Her mind and senses were clearing quickly, but her confusion was mounting. She could tell now that her cot was under a green canopy and that William was the only one next to her. She tried to sit up, but still found herself weak. They were on a grassy hill top somewhere high in the mountains. “How did I get her? Where have you been?” William had a troubled look on his face. She could tell she was asking him too much all at once, but in her nervousness she couldn't help it. A sudden thought curdled her blood. “Are we dead?”

William heaved a sigh. “No, we're not dead. At least not yet.” He paused for a moment, then went on when Sarah kept looking at him in the eye, demanding answers. “We are in the virtual world I told you I was working on. We're being held captive—”

Elizabeth's voice shattered the air, coming from the bottom of the hill where she had been sitting alone. “No, Dean. Don't do it!” She jumped up and came running toward them. “William, if you don't help him, He's going to hurt Sarah!”

“What?” said William, visibly afraid.

Any answer Elizabeth may have been about to give was cut of by Sarah's piercing cry. She clutched her left arm protectively to her body and in a spasm tumbled out of the cot and onto the grass. William immediately dropped to her side and held her as she sobbed. After only a few seconds passed, Sarah screamed and tried to push William away.

“Sarah, what's wrong? I'm not hurting you.” William didn't know if he should hold her close or let her go. She responded to his voice but looked into space focusing on things he couldn't see. William wheeled on Elizabeth who had crumpled on the ground. Grabbing her shoulders and pulling her up to look her in the eye, he demanded, “What is Dean doing to her?”

“He is using a spliced mental connection with her. At any time he can play a recording to one of her senses that overrides the information being sent from the Endless Frontier.” Her words were strained and were broken by occasional sobs. “He can make her feel like she is burning alive, play recordings of starving children in her ears, make her see nothing but bullets and burning buildings around her. You have to stop him, William.”

William encased Sarah, who was now shuddering uncontrollably, in his arms. Great tears formed in his eyes and flowed without restraint. “Sarah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sarah,” he whispered in her ears, not even sure what torment she was going through.  She suddenly went limp in his arms, even her breath stopped.

William jumped and took the phone from where Elizabeth had let if fall, still open. “Dean stop it now. I'll talk, just stop.” He gasped the words out in heaving breaths.

“Okay, I've stopped it,” Deans voice was calm, like they were engaged in small talk over lunch.

William looked over at Sarah and saw her chest rising and falling, but still unconscious. “What do you want from me?” he asked.

“Plans and diagrams on how to construct another computer like this one. Then if I can't find someone who can build it, I want you to build me one.”

“Will you let Sarah go.”

“I can't have her run to the police.”

“Why should I help you? You want everything and promise nothing in return.”

“You and your friends can live happily ever after in the world you have created, otherwise I'll dispose of Troy and Jim, move you and Sarah to a better location where I don't have to pay rent. There I will play with Sarah's senses until I break your will, I'm sure that will be much quicker than breaking your will directly. In the end you will help me either way.”

William felt hollow inside. He was ready to die, but he couldn't watch Sarah suffer. “Please Dean, give me an hour. Just to think.”

“What is there to think about?”

“Only an hour. Just one hour.”

“I'll call you in an hour. If you don't answer, or I don't like your answer, Sarah will feel her back bend and snap, repeated every ten seconds for the next five days!”

Already broken, William openly wept.

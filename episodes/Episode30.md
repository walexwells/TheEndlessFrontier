Sarah awoke shortly after William got off the phone with Dean, but William was too distraught to talk. He sat on the hill looking down the river; tears marked his tired face. Elizabeth sat down with Sarah and unwound their bizarre situation to her. Although some distance away and with his back to them, William listened as Elizabeth told the tale, starting with Troy's grand vision of the Endless Frontier. A few times during the narrative, Sarah asked a question. William had missed her voice, and relished each word she spoke, but his rejoicing in her presence was poisoned by the knowledge that Dean had degraded her into a bartering chip. Her well being depended on his cooperation with the man who had robbed him of everything, twisting his masterpiece into a cage.

About the time Elizabeth was recounting the storm, Troy Lombardi appeared, standing on the Origin in the default clothing. Seeing William, he took a few steps in his direction before falling to his knees. William ran down the hill, concern for Troy let him forget his own problems for a minute. Troy was crumpled on the ground when William reached him. Troy's eyes were closed, but when William shook him, he opened them for a moment.

“The Horizon—” Troy whispered, then closed his eyes.

“What?” asked William, afraid to hope.

Barely audible, Troy said one final word before sleep enclosed him: “—open.”

Suddenly very aware of the camera mounted near them, William calmly picked Troy up and carried him up the hill. Elizabeth and Sarah hadn't noticed William's absence, but they both stopped talking and gave him their full attention when he appeared carrying Troy.

“What happened?”

“Who is that?”

William didn't answer them until he had fully passed the crest of the hill and knew that Dean couldn't see them. “The Horizon is open.” Elizabeth opened her mouth, forming a question, but William kept talking. “Troy must have gotten to the portal. I think Dean drugged him and sent him back in. If the three of us escape at the same time, I'm sure we will be able to overpower him. We went south and Troy went north; I think the quickest way out would be to head east: that ridge isn't has high. Elizabeth, I haven't been paying attention to time, how long do we have before my hour is up?”

“I don't know, maybe a half-hour, forty minutes at most.”

“I'll take the phone and talk to Dean when he calls—stall him as long as I can. He'll drug me before he pulls me out. Don't stop for me.” Even as he was talking William began walking, then when the girls followed he increased the speed to a jog.

As soon as they entered the trees they fell into line, William took the lead and Elizabeth held up the rear. There wasn't much of a trail, but the forest had only sparse underbrush, leaving the way forward mostly clear.

When William accidentally led them into the thick patch of brush, Sarah found a quick way through and took the lead, pushing the groups speed even faster then they had been going. Had they not been in the Endless Frontier, with a computer generated perfect fitness level, they never would have been able to keep going.

Running behind Sarah, William found himself admiring her. Dumped in a totally foreign world she hardly understood, exposed to torture of the most brutal kind, and finding a boy friend she must have given up on a long time ago and who had hardly even spoken to her, she was doing amazing well. With only a short explanation she was leading a charge through the wilderness on the faint hope of escape. Not having time to do anything about her long hair, she had tied it in a knot behind her head. Like everything else about her, he found that knot attractive.

As they ran up a grassy hill, William came up next to Sarah. “I'm sorry, you were pulled into this,” he said.

“I honestly can't say I'm glad to be here,” she responded quickly, “but I'm glad to see you alive.” Her voice dropped to a whisper that William could barely hear as they ran. “I never thought I would see you again.”

After about half an hour, the group had to slow down. They had reached the foothills and were all out of breath. As they walked William pointed out a canyon that he knew turned into the random horizon. He told the girls that would be the easiest route, but that they would have to cross a small stream multiple times as they ascended. “If we were on a Saturday afternoon hike, I would also mention the beautiful wildflowers,” he finished, somewhat surprised at the happiness he was feeling. They were going to make it! And even better, he thought, Sarah had missed him.

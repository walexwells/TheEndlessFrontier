William decided to let it ring a few times. Every second counted. They were further along then he had hoped they would be. He guessed they were two thirds of the way up the canyon. Following behind Sarah, he plunged into the stream for the third time. This crossing wasn't as bad as the last one, it was wide and mostly shallow.

Buzzz. Buzzz. Buzzz.

In the deepest part he comically let the water cover the cell phone, just because he knew it wouldn't hurt it in the least. Although unfinished, it was intended to be the link to reality, and he had made it waterproof.

Buzzz. Buzzz. Buzzz.

“Aren't you going to answer that?” asked Sarah as they jogged along the gravel bank. William caught a hint of worry in her voice, and he wondered if Elizabeth had told her about Dean's threat before he started listening to their conversation earlier. Either way, he knew she was right. For all their sakes, he needed to answer the phone.

“Don't slow down for me,” he said, then dropped to a walk.

Buzzz. Buzzz. Buzzz.

He waited just long enough to be able to hide his heavy breathing. “Hello,” he said in an intentionally discouraged voice.

“Well, William, I gave you your hour and a little more besides. Are you going to help me now or do I have to kill some of your friends and torture another first?” Dean wasn't helping him waste any time.

“Tell me what happens if I agree. I want a specific agreement, not just an arbitrary I do what you say.” The girls were already out of his sight, but he continued walking, following their footsteps.

“Well, the first thing that happens is I take Sarah on a road trip out to a cabin I've purchase for this very purpose. I'll lock her up there, then come back for you. I've rigged the cabin to burn down with her trapped in it, if for some reason you prevent me from getting back there. With your cooperation we should get there in a few days without any problem, well before the trap springs.”

Although the plan sounded horrific, William was grateful it was complicated enough to take some time explaining.

“Actually, I misspoke. I won't take you to the same cabin. I'll take you to another cabin and lock you up there. After ensuring that Sarah will stay alive, I'll come back for the computer and things and we'll set up another Endless Frontier in the cabin. With you safely in it, I'll go and get Sarah and bring her to you. Back in the Endless Frontier, you'll be able to see her. For a few hours each day, I'll pull you out and have you work for me. On days you don't work for me, I'll take it out on Sarah, but hopefully we don't have to worry about that.”

“What about Troy, Jim, and Elizabeth?” asked William. Dean hesitated and William wondered if Dean had just hoped he would forget about them because he was worried about Sarah.

“I'll sedate Troy and take him when I take Sarah. Jim and Elizabeth will come with us, also sedated, when we go.”

“Would I be sedated?”

“No, I only want to make two trips, and I am certain with Sarah's life at stake you won't do anything foolish.”

William knew he was right. He reached a spot where he was was blocked by boulders and a small cliff. He could have easily climbed them with both hands, but with the phone he was forced to stop. They should be getting close now, he thought. “What happens after I give you the plans?”

“With as much money as I'll have after being able to sell the technology, I'll be easily able to afford a babysitter to watch over the five of you. You can live happily ever after, in your digital world.”

“Where did you get the money for those cabins? I remember a week ago you were worried about paying rent.”

Dean laughed. “Your friend Troy helped me on that one. Thanks to him I have plenty of—Hey, what—” The line died.

With a surge of excitement, William dropped the phone, scrambled over the rocks, and ran for the horizon.

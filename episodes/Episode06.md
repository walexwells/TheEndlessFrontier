“Police now suspect that missing billionaire Troy Lombardi may have abandoned his fortune and gone to live the life of a hermit,” said a voice mixed with static. 

Jim Senoma turned up the car radio, so he could hear it above the rumble of his old truck.  

“Mr. Lombardi is a professed outdoor fanatic and has been on trips into many of the worlds remotest areas.  His personal secretary said that he has spent large amounts of money on a secret project he calls the Endless Frontier and that he once described it to her as the fulfillment of his dreams.

“He was last seen just over a month ago when he left his office after working for only a few minutes.  He told his secretary that he had other plans and was going to take the day off.”

“Police investigation revealed that he has been withdrawing large amounts of cash, upwards of a billion dollars, in the last year.  His secretary admitted that she is aware of at least one account that Mr. Lombardi uses under an assumed name, and suspects he has more.  Officials believe that Mr. Lombardi may have used the money to construct a resort in secrecy to which he has now retired.

“A second, perhaps related, incident was reported yesterday.  A local man, by the name of William Kilgore was reported missing by his landlord who had tried unsuccessfully to collect rent for two weeks.  The last confirmed sighting of the man was two days before Mr. Lombardi's disappearance.  

“Sarah Micheals, a friend of the missing man, who saw him last, suggested that his disappearance may be related to the disappearance of Mr. Lombardi.  According to her Mr. Kilgore had told her on multiple occasions that he worked for Troy Lombardi.  However, the claim has yet to be verified.

“You are listening to News Both Local and National on . . .”

Jim turned the radio off.  He pulled out his cell phone and dialed while he waited for a street light to turn green.  When the light turned green, he shifted the truck into gear and resumed driving. 

“Hello,” said Dean, Jim's brother, over the phone.

“Hi Dean, how are thing going?”

“Fine.”

“I just heard a story on the radio about a missing William Kilgore.  Isn't that the guy you mentioned to me a while back?  The one that was going to do some computer work for you.”

“Yes,  he was going to work with me, but he changed his mind at the last minute.  I'm still looking for someone else to do it.”

“What do you think about Mr. Lombardi's disappearance.  Piles and piles of money and poof—he vanishes into thin air.  On the radio they were saying he might have just got up and left it all.  To me it sounds fishy.  Like someone knocked him off of something.  What do you think.”

The line was quiet for a few minutes. 

“Jim.  I'm glad you called.  I've gotten myself into a little trouble.  I need your help.  Could you  help me?”

“Sure Dean, what's wrong.”

“I don't want to talk about it over the phone.  Could you stop by sometime soon?”

“Sure I'm running a few errands for Susan anyway.  I can get to your house in a few minutes.”

After hanging up the phone Jim pushed a little harder on the gas.  Something was wrong with Dean.  Jim had never hear that kind of quiver in Dean's voice before.  


Twenty minutes latter they stood in an office building in front of a door with the words The Portal printed on it.  Dean had been quiet the whole trip there.  He had only told Jim that he wanted to show him something.  Now in front of the door he turned and faced Jim.

“Do you remember when we were little and told lies to mom.  How they always got bigger and bigger, till we ended up in real trouble—I've gotten myself into trouble like that now.  Now it is getting out of control.  I need your help before I end up doing something really terrible.”  Dean spoke quickly.  The words seemed to hurt him.  His jaw quivered as he spoke.

Jim remained silent.  He put one hand on Dean shoulders to give him strength to keep talking.

“I lied to you, the whole family.  I didn't get the government grant.  The money I've been spending comes from an employer who wants to remain hidden.  He doesn't know it. But I used his money to do some illegal things.  Then I got scared that he would find out and report me, so I took some more illegal measures to make sure he would never find out, but I didn't think things through enough.  My lies have gotten more and more expensive.  I'm running out of money.”  Dean had his eyes on the floor, obviously afraid.

Jim thought for a long time.  He decided he better learn more before agreeing to anything, he still didn't know how serious Dean's crimes were.

“Who is your employer?” asked Jim.

Dean jerked back from him.  “Why does it matter to you?  He wants to remain a secret.”

“Sorry.  I'm just trying to understand.  That's all.”

Dean relaxed again.  “No, I'm sorry.  I'm just so scared all the time now.” Suddenly he snapped up his head, “I don't want to do it, Jim.  They've left me no choice!” he said in fiery whisper.

“What do they want you to do?”

“It doesn't matter what they want anymore.  No one will ever find them, but I don't want to kill them, Jim.  I have something here in this room that I need to hide.” He gestured to the door. “I need to use your cabin,  I'm not going to be able to pay rent soon.  I don't know how long, only till I find somewhere more permanent.”

Jim thoughts spun, trying to make sense of everything Dean said.  The implications horrified him.  Dean was contemplating murder.  He already had something he was desperate to hide.

“Dean.”  Jim paused searching hard for the right words to say. “I want to help you. I want you to be free from the lies.  They are just like the lies we told mother.  If you keep them hidden they will only get bigger.  Let's go in to your office and use the phone to call the police.  I'll be right here with you.  If you end this now it will work out in the end.  Don't let whatever it is get any bigger.”

Dean stopped shivering as Jim spoke.  A inner resolve pushed back his fear.  He raised his head and looked Jim in the eye.  “You don't care about me do you.  You're just afraid for yourself.  I come to you for help and you just push me away.  I don't care if the whole world is against me.  I'm not going to give up, Jim.”  The look in his eye sparked fear in Jim's heart, what had happened to his childhood friend.

Dean opened the door and pushed Jim into the room.  Jim didn't resist; he knew he was stronger than Dean and could escape if needed.  What he saw puzzled, then horrified him. Two people with multiple IVs and tubes connected to their bodies lay on beds.  They appeared sound asleep.  

“Troy Lombardi,” gasped Jim in recognition.  He turned to Dean horrified. 

At that moment Dean lunged at Jim.  Jim felt a sharp pain on his arm.  As Dean pulled back his hand he saw he was holding a syringe.  Throwing Dean aside Jim ran for the door, but the drug overcame him and he collapsed just a few feet outside.

A few hours later when the drug wore off  he awoke, lying face down on a hard stone floor.  Pushing himself to his knees, he saw that he was no longer inside.  All around him was a beautiful wilderness.   On the stone in front of him was engraved one large word,  “Origin.”

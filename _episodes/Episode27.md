Buzzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzz.

William felt the cold hard stone of the origin under him. Trying to relieve his aching head, he sat up and covered his hands against the bright light of the morning sun. I am alive, he thought. He remembered watching as Elizabeth lost strength and dipped beneath the waves. Pointlessly he had shouted her name. The urge to save her had almost given him the strength to dive after her, but he knew he was struggling just to keep his own head above water. Even in the freezing water, his arms and legs burned from the effort to stay alive. In the back of his mind he was aware that all the struggle was pointless, but the situation was just too real.

He remembered slipping beneath the waves, unable to wave his arms and legs any longer. Then heavy water water rushed in to fill his lungs as bad air burst out. Then darkness. I'm alive, he thought, almost disbelieving, I'm alive.

Buzzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzz.

He only vaguely remembered hearing the first ring of his phone, but he ignored it a second time and looked around. A few feet to in front of him he saw Elizabeth, still unconscious in the default clothing. The pine forests and rugged mountains of the Origin valley surrounded him in all their majesty, but the sight only wearied him. He turned to look over his shoulder at the camera, wondering if Dean was watching him. A second woman lay between him and the camera, also with long hair and in the default clothing. Startled he jumped up and went to her. Kneeling over her he saw that this woman was Elizabeth. Then who was the first?

Buzzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzz.

Cautiously walking over to her came to a horrible realization.

“NO! No. No. No. No No.” he cried. Behind  him he heard Elizabeth stir, but ignored it. He ran to Sarah's side and gently shook her. She remained totally unconscious, barely even breathing.

Buzzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzz.

“What have you done to her!” William shouted into the phone, speaking before he was even sure it had connected.

“Uhhh—William, where are you?”

Williams voice suddenly dropped cool and hardened. “What have you done to Sarah?”

“I didn't know you would be at the Origin this morning,” answered Dean weakly.

“I died last night, but that is beside the point. What have you done to Sarah.”

William's shouting fully aroused Elizabeth. She moved over to Sarah and seeing a patient her medical training kicked in. She became cool and collected and began to look for a pulse.

“William, I promise you she is fine,” said Dean. “I wanted to talk to you before you saw her, but I guess that it too late now.”

“Why is she here.”

“This isn't about her, William. It's about you. I need your help.”

“I don't care what you do to me. Why is she here!”

“I know you don't care about yourself. She is my insurance. You won't help me for your own sake, so I'm asking you to help me for hers.”

Elizabeth had grasped the situation the moment she had seen Sarah. A part of her tried to convince her that she should be happy about it. With Sarah here, William was sure to cooperate. But she had learned that it was that same part of her that had let Dean pull her into this mess in the first place. No, she thought, another victim. Sarah is another victim, and Dean is the monster.

William was still as stone for a few long seconds. Elizabeth could tell that he didn't want to believe what was happening, but was trying to deal with it anyway.

“Listen to me Dean,” he said. “A week ago, you were right. I was going to die before I helped you. But a few days ago your brother Jim changed my mind. He wants to live much more than I do, so does Elizabeth. I was going to help you for their sakes, but not now.” Surprised Elizabeth looked up at him, but he wasn't looking at her. “I love Sarah more than anyone in the world, but I cannot help you now. How many people will you trap before this is over Dean? A hundred? No Dean I'll let Sarah die with the rest of us before I have to breath each day knowing others are trapped because I assisted you.” With a finality she knew she could not contest, William threw he phone to the ground. The plastic casing shattered, and little pieces scattered.

Without a word, William put Sarah on his shoulders and began to hike over the hill toward the lodge. Elizabeth waited for a moment, trying to get a grasp on what had happened before following. She met he at the top of the hill where he had stopped.

“Where is the lodge?” she asked, seeing the wreckage.

“I have no idea,” he replied. For a moment the two of them stood looking at the wreckage. William came to himself first, setting Sarah down on the grass. He gathered a canopy and cot from the mound of supplies that had replaced the shed, wading through a bit of water and generally having to clear a path through the rubble.

Elizabeth sat down next to Sarah and waited for him to return. “What are we going to do now?” she asked him.

“You start working on the canopy. I'll get the cot set up so Sarah doesn't have to lie on the ground.”

“I mean what are we going to do about Dean? About trying to stay alive?”

“We can't stop Dean from killing us.” As he spoke William opened up the cot bag and began piecing the different parts together. “If he does, it will be on his own prerogative; I'll have nothing to do with it. Right now I plan to do what I can for Sarah. If Dean doesn't kill us, I'll start pushing the horizon again, unless I can come up with a better plan of escape. Regardless of the method, I will always try to get out. But I will not—I will never—don't even ask me to—bargain with Dean.”
